# Brand site with music

## Overview

This project is a minimalist, single-page website designed to showcase fundamental web development skills through visual and interactive design. The concept is based on a clean, atmospheric aesthetic with hidden elements that are revealed through a hover-based interaction. The primary focus of this project was to experiment with advanced CSS properties to create a unique user experience.

## Key Learnings & Features

1. Custom Font Integration: I utilized @font-face to incorporate a custom serif font, which adds a distinct and professional feel to the design.

2. Interactive Hover Effects: I used a combination of position: absolute, opacity, and CSS transition properties to create a smooth, fading effect for the music player and text. This demonstrates an understanding of how to build complex, non-static layouts.

3. Audio Integration: The site includes a native HTML <audio> element, allowing for the seamless playback of an audio track directly on the page.

4. Separation of Concerns: The project maintains a clean structure with HTML handling the content and CSS managing all styling, which is a best practice for web development.

## Technologies Used
1. HTML5: Used for the core structure of the page.

2. CSS3: Utilized for styling, including custom fonts, transitions, and hover effects.

## How to Run

  To run this project, ensure you have the styles.css file and the rusilla-serif-font folder in the same directory as the index.html file. You will also need to have the flowers-aesthetic-edited.png and the audio file in their respective folders as linked in the code. Then, simply open index.html in any modern web browser.

## Future Improvements

This project serves as an excellent foundation for more advanced web development concepts. Potential future improvements could include:

1. Responsiveness: Implementing media queries to ensure the layout remains visually appealing on a variety of screen sizes.

2. User Interface for Audio: Adding custom JavaScript controls (play, pause, volume) for the music player to provide a more tailored user experience.

3. Backend Integration: Storing music file paths in a database and dynamically loading them to create a more robust music player.
